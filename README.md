# codescanner
Scans and detects vulnerable functions in PHP, Java, Python, .Net and Javascript code.

# What does it do?
This script scans PHP, Java, Python, .Net and Javascript code files and checks if they contain any vulnerable functions listed in the "vulnerable_functions.yaml" file. If any of the listed vulnerable functions in the yaml file are found, the script prints the function names and the line numbers at where they are found.

The yaml file can be updated with additional vulnerable functions as required.
